# Brain_Tumor_Detection_CodeClause_Intern_Project
Brain tumor detection refers to the process of identifying the presence of tumors or abnormal growths within the brain using medical imaging and diagnostic techniques. Tumors in the brain can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous), and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management.

The process of brain tumor detection typically involves the following steps:

# Medical History and Symptoms:
The patient's medical history and symptoms are evaluated by a medical professional. Symptoms of brain tumors can vary widely and may include headaches, seizures, cognitive changes, motor coordination difficulties, and more.

# Physical Examination:
A physical examination is conducted to assess neurological functions, such as reflexes, coordination, and sensory perception. Neurological deficits can provide important clues about the presence and location of a brain tumor.

# Imaging Techniques:

# 1.Computed Tomography (CT):
CT scans use X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the brain. They can help identify the size, location, and density of tumors.
# 2.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): 
MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate detailed images of the brain's internal structures. It provides better visualization of soft tissues and can help distinguish between different types of brain tumors.
# 3.Positron Emission Tomography (PET):
PET scans involve injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the body to visualize metabolic activity in different regions of the brain. This can help differentiate between active tumor tissue and healthy tissue.
Biopsy: In some cases, a biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample from the tumor. This sample is then analyzed by a pathologist to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant and its specific characteristics.

# Blood Tests:
Blood tests may be conducted to assess various markers that could indicate the presence of a brain tumor or provide information about the overall health of the patient.

# Advanced Imaging Techniques:
Emerging technologies such as functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and spectroscopy can provide additional information about the tumor's location, size, and impact on surrounding brain tissue.

# Computer-Aided Diagnosis:
Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are being increasingly used to aid in the detection and classification of brain tumors. These algorithms analyze medical images and assist radiologists in identifying potential abnormalities.
